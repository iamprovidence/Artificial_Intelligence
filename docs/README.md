# Artificial intelligence (AI)

**Artificial intelligence (AI)**, sometimes called *machine intelligence*, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. 

In computer science AI research is defined as the study of "*intelligent agents*": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.

The term "*artificial intelligence*" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
